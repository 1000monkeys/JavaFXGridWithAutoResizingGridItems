Hello, This is a JavaFX Grid handler which auto resize's the grid items!

I made it to quickly create some of the projects I am or am going to work on for school.

It handles every Node for UI I could find, It does not handle making the pane too small for the items in the scene but i did this on purpose so that you are more free in creating the grid.

Greetings,
Kjell Vos
